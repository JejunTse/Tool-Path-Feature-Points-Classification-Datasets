# Tool-Path-Feature-Points-Classification-Datasets
In this repository, it contains training and testing data for the algorithm of tool path feature points classification.

The folder Training data contains FP-GNN training data, which includes three folders:
1) CAD Model: Represents the 3D model file of the training part
2) CAD Model NCCode: Represents the machining G code corresponding to the training part, where the naming convention for G code files is Part name. Cutting angle. nc
3) Feature Point Flag: Represents the feature point labels corresponding to the tool paths of the training parts

The folder Test data contains FP-GNN testing data, which includes 10 folders corresponding to the results of the 10 testing parts in the paper.
